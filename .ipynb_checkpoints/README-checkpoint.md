Waveform simulator for LArTPC PMTs

Based off of waveform simulator from `larnd-sim`, but includes stochastic processes for scintillation delay and TPB wavelength shifter re-emission. Also includes functionality to generate pre-simulation waveforms as inputs.

Notebooks:
* Look at `00_input_gen.ipynb` to use waveform generator
* Look at `01_stochastic_simulator.ipynb` to apply simulation
